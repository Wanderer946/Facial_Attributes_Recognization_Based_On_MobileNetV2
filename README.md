# Facial_Attributes_Recognization_Based_On_MobileNetV2
A face multi-attribute classification method based on MobileNetV2
## Overview
This project aims to build a lightweight, multi-label facial attribute recognition system. Based on the MobileNet_V2 network architecture, it achieves efficient and accurate classification and prediction of multiple facial attributes of the people in the images (such as gender, expression, posture, etc.). The project covers the complete process including data preprocessing, model design, training optimization, and result visualization, and is suitable for deployment on devices with limited computing power.
